The code provided calculates the number of days between two dates using the formula for converting dates into a "day number" or Julian Day Number. This approach is based on the formula for converting dates to an absolute day count.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Conversion to Day Number**:
   - The given code uses a formula to convert a date into an absolute number of days since a fixed reference point.

2. **Formula Breakdown**:
   - **Month Adjustment**: `m1 = (m1 + 9) % 12;` This shifts the month so that January and February are treated as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
   - **Year Adjustment**: `y1 = y1 - m1 / 10;` Adjusts the year to account for the shifted months.
   - **Day Calculation**: The formula then calculates the total number of days by summing days from years, leap years, months, and days.

3. **Day Number Calculation**:
   - `x1` and `x2` represent the number of days from a reference date to the given dates.
   - The calculation `365*y1 + y1/4 - y1/100 + y1/400 + (m1*306 + 5)/10 + (d1 - 1)` converts a given date into an absolute day number.
     - `365*y1`: Days from full years.
     - `y1/4 - y1/100 + y1/400`: Adjustments for leap years.
     - `(m1*306 + 5)/10`: Days from months.
     - `(d1 - 1)`: Days from the given day of the month.

4. **Calculate Difference**:
   - `Math.abs(x2 - x1)`: Computes the absolute difference between the day numbers for the two dates.

### Simplified Approach

Although the provided solution is accurate, it can be simplified and made more readable using Javaâ€™s built-in `LocalDate` class from the `java.time` package. This is both more readable and less error-prone.

Here's a simplified version using `LocalDate`:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;

class Solution {
    static long noOfDays(int d1, int m1, int y1, int d2, int m2, int y2) {
        LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.of(y1, m1, d1);
        LocalDate date2 = LocalDate.of(y2, m2, d2);
        return Math.abs(ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(date1, date2));
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Simplified Code

1. **Create LocalDate Objects**:
   - `LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.of(y1, m1, d1);` creates a `LocalDate` object for the first date.
   - `LocalDate date2 = LocalDate.of(y2, m2, d2);` creates a `LocalDate` object for the second date.

2. **Calculate Difference**:
   - `ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(date1, date2)` calculates the number of days between the two dates.
   - `Math.abs(...)` ensures that the result is always positive.

### Benefits of Using LocalDate

- **Readability**: The code is much clearer and easier to understand.
- **Correctness**: `LocalDate` handles all the intricacies of date calculations, including leap years and month lengths, automatically.
- **Simplicity**: Reduces the risk of errors in date calculations. 

This approach leverages Java's standard library to handle date arithmetic efficiently and accurately.
